# Little Lemon Restaurant API

## Overview

Welcome to my Little Lemon Restaurant API project! This repository represents the final capstone project for the Meta Back-End Developer Professional Certificate. Throughout this project, I've built a RESTful API using Django and the Django REST Framework to manage restaurant functionalities like menu management and table bookings. Itâ€™s been an exciting journey demonstrating my skills in back-end development and solving real-world problems.

## Course Syllabus

Here's a brief overview of how I tackled this project through the course modules:

### Module 1: Starting the Project

- **Setup:** I began by setting up my development environment and getting acquainted with Django.
- **Goals:**
  - Built a back-end application using Django.
  - Served static HTML content.
  - Committed the project to a Git repository.

### Module 2: Project Functionality

- **Database Models:** I connected to MySQL and created the necessary models for the application.
- **APIs:** I developed and implemented APIs for managing menus and booking tables using Django REST Framework.

### Module 3: Security and Testing

- **Authentication:** Added user registration, login, and logout functionalities to secure the application.
- **Security:** Implemented measures to protect the table booking API and ensure data integrity.
- **Testing:** Conducted unit tests and tested API endpoints with the Insomnia REST client.
- **GitHub:** Pushed all my code commits to GitHub.

### Module 4: Graded Assessment

- **Assessment:** I compared my code and design with my peers, tackled some of the most challenging parts of the project, and completed a graded assessment.
